1. Remove the Hello World TextView.
2. Add a RecyclerView to the constraint layout, set attr to match_parent,
   and id to rvMaps.

DEFINE THE MODELS
3. Create new package called model in the mymaps dir.
4. Create new class file in model dir, and name it UserMap as
   this is an obvious model that represents a map the user has created.
5. Create a data class named UserMap in the UserMap.kt file.
6. Pass the attr of the map in the UserMap data class, such as every map
   needs a title, so val title of <T> String, and a list of markers,
   and each marker actually represents a place, val places of <T> Place
   into the primary constructor of the class. We'll define Place next.
7. In the model directory create a new class file name Place.kt by clicking
   on the red Place <T> and click more options, then click create new class.
   Click create new file, choose the destination to be of the model dir.
   Click ok.
8. (if you performed step 7, this should be taken care of by Android Studio),
   In the Place.kt file create a data class named Place (remember a
   data class contains only data, no functionality, and must contain
   at least one parameter in the primary constructor.
9. Each place is a marker that is at a particular location on the map
   which will have a title, description, and (coordinates).
   val title <T> String, val description <T> String, val latitude <Double>,
   val longitude <T> Double.

10. In ActivityMain set the layout manager by creating an instance of the
    LinearLayoutManager and assign it to the layoutManager property of
    the recycler view rvMaps, then pass in the context, this. Which will
    be a linear layout be default which is what we want.
11. Next set the adapter on the recycler view by creating an instance of
    the MapsAdapter (create next), and pass in two parameters, the context,
    this; and pass in our data, which will be a list of <T> UserMap
    (for now, emptyList<UserMap>()).
12. Click on the red MapsAdapter, and click make new class, extract from
    file, destination the MainActivity dir (myMaps in this case), creates new class file and a
    template of the MapsAdapter class

13. Create Our Own Adapter
    Change the MapsAdapter parameters from mainActivity: MainActivity to context: Context,
    and val userMaps: emptyList: List<UserMap>.
14. Create our own ViewHolder
    Make the MapsAdapter inherit the from the adapter class Adapter of the class of the RecyclerView
    and type ViewHolder a child of RecyclerView by
    appending : RecyclerView.Adapter<RecyclerView.ViewHolder>() after the MapsAdapter class parameter
    list.
15. Inside the body of the MapsAdapter class, create a nested class of ViewHolder, and have it
    inherit from the RecyclerView.ViewHolder class then match the parent class constructor which
    takes in itemView  class ViewHolder(itemView: ItemView) : RecyclerView.ViewHolder(itemView)
16. Now go back to the MapsAdapter class and change the inherited type of the parent ViewHolder to
    reference the type of our ViewHolder by changing RecyclerView.Adapter<RecyclerView.ViewHolder>()
    to RecyclerView.Adapter<MapsAdapter.ViewHolder>()
    Note: If you don't choose ViewHolder com.example.mymaps.MapsAdapter from the autofill you
    may have to import our ViewHolder com.example.mymaps.MapsAdapter
    Change emptyList to val userMaps, and make sure context: Context is declared with the keyword val.

17. Implement the Abstract Methods for our adapter
    Click on the MapsAdapter red light and implement members, all three, onCreateViewHolder,
    getItemCount, and onBindViewHolder.
18. Rahul personal preference is to move the nested ViewHolder class to the bottom of the MapsAdapter
    class, underneath the members. You can highlight the class, and then SHIFT + ALT + arrow up or down.
19. getItemCount() is the easiest to implement,
    call size with dot notation to access the size property of our dataset userMaps.size; NOT return
    if you one-line it!
20. onCreateViewHolder's purpose is to inflate the view and wrap that inside a VeiwHolder, pass in
    context, and inflate the layout, and instead of making our own, we'll inflate a premade one from
    Android Studio by passing in android.R.layout.simple_list_item_1, parent, attachToRoot: false to
    the inflate() function.
    LayoutInflater.from(context).inflate(R.layout.simple_list_item_1, parent, attachToRoot: false)
    and then wrap the inflated view inside a ViewHolder by return ViewHolder(view). We are returning
    an instance of ViewHolder with a view as the parameter.
21. onBindViewHolder() responsibility is to grab the data which is at this "position",  and bind it
    to the view located inside the view holder, by passing it to the view holder, holder.
    To get the position simply get the element at position of our list and assign it to a declared
    val named userMap by indexing into our dataset, val userMap = userMaps[position]
22. Then bind it, first look to see what is inside our templated layout simple_list_item_1, click on
    it then CTRL + B will take you to the layout file.  Scroll down and see the id of the TeztView,
    is text1.  Now go back to onBindViewHolder() and declare a reference to that TeztView, tezt1
    with val textViewTitle = holder.itemView.findViewById<TextView>(android.R.id.text1). We use the
    android.R.id, because this text view is from the android sdk
23. Then update the text in the TextView text1 by textVeiwTitle.text = userMap.title with the title.
24. Run the app, we should get a blank screen as we have not passed any data to the adapter.
16.25
25. Generate data... some list  https://gist.github.com/rpandey1234/19d9be3f6436080763e2eaf4adbf0b16
    Here is a data list, paste it into the MainActivity underneath the closing curly braces of
    onCreate().
    There is a method named generateSampleData, which returns a list of usermap List<UserMap>
    Each UserMap contains the attributes we already defined in our data class, name, descr. lat, long.
26. So now call this method and store it in a variable name userMaps in the onCreate(), just under
    setContentView, in MainActivity
27. Now that variable userMaps can be the data to be displayed in the recyclerView. So pass
    userMaps into the MapsAdapter constructor in place of emptyList<UserMap>.
28. Run the app again we should now see a list of places
    18.10
29. Navigate to a new map acitivity
    Set a click listener on item view
    The first step is we need to understand when did an item in the recycler view
    actually get clicked?
    Set a click listener on the item view.
    holder.itemView.setOnClickListener { take some action }
    highlight holder.itemView, move one line up, enter for a line to code,
    paste holder.itemView.setOnClickListener {
        LOG.i()
    }
30. Create a top level private const variable named TAG of Type String, and follow convention
    Convention for a log statement is the name of the class it is in. "MapsAdapter"
31. Now pass TAG, and "Tapped on Position $position" as the parameters to Log.i(). If Log
    remains red, you may have to import Log import android.util.Log
32. Now run it, and open Logcat, Search for MapsAdapter, level info, show only app
    Then tap on the various places on the emulator and they should show in Logcat,
    as e.g. I/MapsAdapter: Tapped on position 3
33. What we would like is for MainActivity to get notified of a tap, and then
    MainActivity should be the place where we do the navigation to another screen.
    GOTO MainActivity and inside onCreate, but at just above the closing curly brace,
    add:
    // When user taps on item (view) in recycler view navigate to a new activity
34. Define an Interface
    We need to define an interface in the MapsAdapter and passing a implementation
    of that interface (an instance) into the MapsAdapter constructor.
    GOTO MapsAdapter and under the class declaration but before onCreate, add:
    interface OnClickListener { //
        fun onItemClick(position: Int) // one function called onItemClick that will take in a position
    }
35. Now add this onto the parameter of the constructor, of MapsAdapter following
    val UserMaps parameter, separated by a comma.

36. Pass an object instance of the Interface (MapsAdapter.onClickListener) into MapsAdapter and
    GOTO MainActivity, there is an error that we have not yet passed in the interface
    Pass in to MapsAdapter assignment of rv.Maps.adapter object: MapsAdapter.onClickListener {}
    rv.Maps.adapter = MapsAdapter( this, userMaps, object: MapsAdapter.onClickLister {

    })
37. Define Implementation Member
    Then you will need to define an implementation method, by clicking on the
    the red underlined object, then click on implement members on the popup
    it will create override fun onItemClick(position: Int) {}
    Define that implementation method by in the curly braces add another log
    statement "onItemClick $position"

38. Declare a top level variable above class MainActivity,
    private const val TAG = "MainActivity"

39. Link a click event from itemClickListener to fire the interface in MainActivity
    GOTO MapsAdapter
    So we are passing in an implementation of the interface but we are not doing
    anything with it onClickListener is currently unused, so the idea, or how
    this is all tied to together is when the item view is clicked on we want to
    fire the method onItemClick() on that interface.
    onClickListener dot onItemClick, and pass in position here. Add:
    onClickListener.onItemClick(position)

40. Now every time a user taps on one of the items in the recycler view we'll call
    this itemClickListener which is part of the interface, and that will then
    alert this code (override fun onItemClick) to be fired and will get this
    log statement.
    Run the app. Open Logcat.
    Now we ezpect to see two log activities each time we click an item,
    one from MapsAdapter, and one from MainActivity
